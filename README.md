# starwars_api

This app allows a user to call the starwars api to get a character name and their eye color based on their position in the json data. Add a number in the number box and you will get a character with their eye color.
There is also a link to get a list of Star Wars movies and a link to go back to the character section.
 Clone the git link and use Live server in VS Code to check it out!
